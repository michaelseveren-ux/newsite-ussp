## Why

The "Why Choose Us" value cards on the homepage are visually flat—white cards on a white section background with no interactive states. This makes them feel static and dated. Adding hover interactions and better visual contrast will create a more engaging, modern experience that draws attention to these key differentiators.

## What Changes

- Add interactive hover effects to the four value cards (scale, shadow lift, subtle color shifts)
- Improve visual contrast by updating the card backgrounds or section background
- Add smooth transitions for a polished, modern feel
- Consider adding accent colors or gradient borders on hover

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
- `value-card-interactions`: Hover effects and transitions for the "Why Choose Us" value cards

### Modified Capabilities
<!-- No existing spec changes needed - this is a visual/interaction enhancement -->

## Impact

- **Files affected**: `src/pages/index.astro` (card markup/classes)
- **Styling**: Tailwind utility classes for hover states, transitions, and backgrounds
- **No breaking changes**: Visual enhancement only
- **Performance**: CSS transitions are GPU-accelerated, minimal impact
