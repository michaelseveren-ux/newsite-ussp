## Why

The homepage services section listed "Flight Training" as one of four offerings — a service US Sport Planes does not provide. Replacing it required understanding the actual business: the company operates as an aircraft broker, representing sellers. This revealed a natural fourth service that was missing entirely: "Sell Your Aircraft" (the seller-facing side of brokerage). Additionally, "Aircraft Sales" was renamed to "Find an Aircraft" to better reflect the buyer experience and the brokerage relationship.

## What Changes

- Remove "Flight Training" from the homepage services array
- Rename "Aircraft Sales" to "Find an Aircraft"
- Add "Sell Your Aircraft" as the fourth service (seller-side brokerage)
- Update descriptions for all four services to reflect honest brokerage positioning

## Capabilities

### Modified Capabilities
- `homepage-layout`: Services section updated with accurate four-service structure

## Impact

- `src/pages/index.astro`: Services data array updated — titles and descriptions only, no layout or structural changes
